# First Steps
## Setting up Wifi
When you first plug in your lamp, it will open up a WiFi access point called 'WLED-AP'. Connect your phone/tablet/computer to this access point using the default password of 'wled1234'. It will open up a page where you can access your lamp. Go to WiFi Settings and set up the access point and password for your home network. When you hit save, the lamp will reboot and should connect to your home WiFi. Now you can connect directly to the lamp.
## Using the app
The IOS/Android app 'wled-native' is my preferred way to control WLED. When you open the app it should show you all WLED devices on the current WiFi network. Choose your lamp and let's get started!
### Effects
The effects menu is where you choose what effect the lamp is showing. The icons have the following meanings ...
### Colors
Where you set the color palette.
### Presets
Where presets are stored. Presets are not just canned settings, although they can be. They can completely set everything on the lamp (color palette/brightness/effect/etc.) or just some of them (for instance, you might make a preset to change the color palette but leave the current effect.) Presets can even store API commands like 'PL=~,P1=1,P2=10' which means "Advance to the next preset from the list 1,2,...,10."
